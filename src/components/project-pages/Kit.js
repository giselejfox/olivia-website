However, users can’t easily track their time balancing, it’s difficult to track progress over time, boards are difficult to store when not in use, aesthetics rarely blend well with home interiors, and it can be difficult to come up with new workout ideas. These pain points were seen as opportunities to enhance the user experience of balance boards using new technology and innovative design."} />
