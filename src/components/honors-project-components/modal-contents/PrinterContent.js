            <p className="py-2">Through my design courses, including studio courses and Materials and Manufacturing, I gained insight into the science of material properties and processes, and learned about different tools for fabrication. Within the Honors class, the Art of Understanding Science, I was exposed to the ways in which artists and experimental designers utilize current manufacturing processes or envision future processes. This information coupled with my passion for making things gave me a sense of empowerment in knowing more about how to make my designs become tangible products with processes like casting, CNC, laser cutting, 3D printing, vacuum forming, injection molding, bonding, and more. I’ve also gained an interest in understanding the future of manufacturing processes and learning more about experimental manufacturing techniques. Over time, I’ve also learned more about the drawbacks and advantages of mass production compared to more bespoke approaches of product fabrication. </p>
