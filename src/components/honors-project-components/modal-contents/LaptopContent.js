        <p className="py-2">Taking Computer Programming I and Honors Computer Programming II at UW as someone who had never coded before was something I initially doubted I should do. I let my curiosity override my intimidation, leading me to my interest in computer science that has continued to today. I was drawn to coding for similar reasons to why I am drawn to physically making things: figuring out how something works and creating through the iterative process of testing and prototyping.</p>
        <p className="py-2">After taking foundational classes, I found ways to utilize what I had learned and grow my understanding through various projects outside of a traditional course structure. I learned more about augmented experiences and interactive technology through my work as a Mary Gates Research Scholar, in which I aided in the development of an AR art installation using Unity. I explored computational computer aided modeling through my design courses. I practiced prototyping apps utilizing Flutter. This entire website itself is custom code!</p>
