            <p className="py-2">Taking Honors courses related to ethnomusicology was an unexpected way for me to combine my passion for music in an academic setting. Considering the ways in which music functions in different cultures, and how music itself reacts to shifts in culture, broadened my perspective on the definition of music and its function in the world. I also gained a wider perspective for considering the design of instruments themselves, and thinking about how the evolution of design and technology has impacted music. I really enjoyed looking at different formats of music throughout history, such as wax cylinders.</p>
