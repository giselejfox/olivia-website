        <div>Participating in Design for America (DFA) during my freshman and sophomore year allowed me to work on long term design projects with my peers across different disciplines. During my second year, I participated as a project leader, and my team and I designed a board game concept. We were inspired to utilize gameplay as a way to encourage social interaction coming out of the isolation of the COVID19 pandemic. The process not only brought me closer to my peers, but it also showed me the ways in which games can be used for forming social connections with others.</div>
        <div>Since then, weekly board game sessions with friends has become a cornerstone of my social life. These gatherings have not only strengthened my bonds with friends but have also provided valuable insights into their thought processes and personalities. Yahtzee, Mieles Bourne, and Bananagrams are our go to games. The small wins and losses we endure in boardgames are the training course for later situations in life. Like my friends say, “don’t be afraid to go for the Yahtzee!”</div>
