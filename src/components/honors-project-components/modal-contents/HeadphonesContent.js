            <p className="py-2">Throughout college I rediscovered the importance of music within my life. Playing guitar, writing songs, using midis, and producing music was not only a way to express my emotions but also a way to bring myself a sense of being in the present moment. Starting a band with one of my closest friends and writing our own music has not only been fun, but a great way to practice creative vulnerability. The creative process often demands a willingness to share ideas, even when you may feel insecure about them.</p>
