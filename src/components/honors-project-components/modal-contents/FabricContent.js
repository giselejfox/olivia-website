            <p className="py-2">Material sustainability has become a huge passion of mine that’s formed over the past years. I started learning about the impact materials have on our health by watching movies like “The Devil We Know,” and reading books like “Fibershed: Growing a Movement of Farmers, Fashion Activists, and Makers for a New Textile Economy.” Through these, I started to think about the ways in which the materials of our products impact our lives in ways we don’t often consider.</p>
            <p className="py-2">I was also able to learn about materials in different professional settings. When I was an interior design intern, I managed a materials library. That experience was formative for me to expose myself to different types of materials and grow a better understanding of why certain materials are used for certain pieces of furniture and products. After, my interest in textiles led me to a Materials Development internship at REI. While I was there, I worked on starting a database of alternative, sustainable dye processes. Being able to talk to international mill partners allowed me to gain insight on emerging dye technologies within an industrial setting. </p>
            <p className="py-2">As a designer, considering material sustainability has become a pillar of my process. Whether I’m upcycling materials, reducing waste through construction processes, or experimenting with biobased materials, I’m considering how to reduce harm on our environment when creating.</p>
