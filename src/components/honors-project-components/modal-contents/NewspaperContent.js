            <p className="px-4">Being an Illustrator for The Daily, the UW student newspaper, has been an enriching experience that allowed me to channel my creative skills in an impactful way. The thrill of seeing my illustrations in print brought a unique sense of accomplishment. The opportunity to contribute to a special edition of The Daily was particularly rewarding. The experience not only allowed me to explore and refine my artistic capabilities but has also provided an opportunity to practice the skill of translating someoneâ€™s idea into a compelling visual medium. It's a learning journey that goes beyond the creative process, fostering a deeper understanding of how visuals can enhance and communicate ideas effectively.</p>
